**boo!** if you're looking for the minecraft mods i am or have been involved in it's wise to to check [the wisp forest org](https://github.com/wisp-forest) in addition to just my own repos.
besides that, a few of the projects i'm most proud of you can find in the pinned repos below.

i like to use the [dart programming language](https://dart.dev) as my weapon of choice for general-purpose applications and scripting, [kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) when i need to write code for the jvm,
java for minecraft modding (because sadly that's what the ecosystem is built for), am proficient in python, typescript and [lua](https://www.lua.org) and know some c, c++ and [ocaml](https://ocaml.org).

my three major topics of interest (i love introspection, and not in the programming sense) at the moment appear to
be serialization, user interfaces and computer graphics - if you inspect a bunch of my repos for some reason you might notice that they tend to be a bit more heavy on those areas.

always remember that ✨silly✨ is a great justification for most projects.

either way, if you actually read this i am very impressed, i salute you and you may have this cookie: [:cookie:](https://youtu.be/yXRlrix-pPk)
