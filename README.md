**boo!** if you're looking for the minecraft mods i am or have been involved in it's wise to to check [the wisp forest org](https://github.com/wisp-forest) in addition to just my own repos.
besides that, a few of the projects i'm most proud of you can find in the pinned repos below.

my three major topics of interest (i love introspection, and not in the programming sense) at the moment appear to
be serialization, user interfaces and computer graphics - if you inspect a bunch of my repos for some reason you might notice that they tend to be a bit more heavy on those areas.

either way, if you actually read this i am very impressed, i salute you and you may have this cookie: üç™
